# Technical Skills in Interviews: related technologies

## Introduction

## Objectives

* Learn how to answer questions about Technologies not necessarily taught in Flatiron School's Data Science Program

## Related technologies

### Table Overview

| Technologies   |      Burning Glass One-liner    |  Flatiron-taught alternative |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| (Apache) Hadoop |  an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of dataset of big data using the MapReduce programming model | PySpark, Apache Spark |
| Apache Hive | Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis |  |
| TensorFLow | An open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is used for machine learning applications and most famously used for models like neural networks | Keras |
| Java | Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment |
| Scala | Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.   Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in both languages may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code.|| 
| SAS | SAS (previously "Statistical Analysis System") is a software suite developed by SAS Institute for advanced analytics, multivariate analyses, business intelligence, data management, and predictive analytics | Python (note that Python is Open-Source, SAS is not)|
| Tableau | Tableau Software ( tab-LOH) is a software company which produces interactive data visualization products focused on business intelligence | Data visualization in Python (matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly) |
